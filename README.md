# MEDISENSE
This system keeps track of a person’s health in real time. It watches pain levels, heart rate, and blood pressure, and smooths sudden changes to see trends clearly. Activity levels are turned into numbers for easier analysis. If pain is very high or blood pressure is too high, an alert pops up, helping people notice risks quickly.
